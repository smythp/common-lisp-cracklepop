## CracklePop in Common Lisp

CracklePop written in Common Lisp. Note that there is no range function in CL, so that has also been implemented.

If you have clisp installed, clone this repository, enter the directory, and run:

	clisp cracklepop.lisp
	
You can install clisp with

    sudo apt-get install clisp
	
on Debian-based systems or

    brew install clisp

on OSX.
